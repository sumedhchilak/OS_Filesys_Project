What did your group do well this week?
We took the time to plan out many parts of the implementation early. This
greatly helped us in setting up the foundations for our project. We also
completed our new syscall functions as well as parts of filesys and inode.







What do you not do well?
We started on the assignment a little late because we needed a few days
of rest after completing Project 3. Therefore, our time management was a
slightly hindered.







How could you improve?
We will make sure to devote an adequate amount of time to the project over the
weekend and over the course of next week to get up to pace before the
deadline.







How well did your group communicate?  Describe any problems and potential 
solutions.
Communication as a group has gone smoothly. We've responded to messages in a
timely manner. We haven't really notice any major problems with our
communication. Overall, it's been pretty good.







How well did you share programming time and collaborate on the design?  
Describe any problems and potential solutions.
We think design ideas and implementations were split evenly among the group
members without any problems.







What are your next steps?
Our next steps are to meet more regularly in order to finish our implementing
filesys and inode. We also plan on looking for more information about file
system concepts from any lectures as well as make more use of Piazza if we
hit any roadblocks.







When are you meeting next week?
Saturday around 2pm
Sunday around 8pm
Monday around 8pm
